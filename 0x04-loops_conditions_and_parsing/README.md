SSH keys are a secure and convenient way to authenticate to a remote server without having to enter a password. To create SSH keys, you will need to generate a public-private key pair and add the public key to the server. The #!/usr/bin/env bash shebang is more portable than #!/bin/bash, as it will use the user's default shell instead of the Bash shell. To loop through a set of commands, you can use the while, until, and for loop commands. Conditional statements such as if, else, elif and case can be used to create branching conditions. The cut command is a Unix utility that is used to extract specific fields from a line of text. Files and other comparison operators can be used to compare one value to another, and are commonly used in shell scripts.
