# Process
This is an instance of a program being executed.In this exercise I learnt that i can take it to mean that it is a copy of instructions yougive to a computer to run,hence the tern execute.While on the subjectit is important to stress the idea of PID. This idea ties to the fact that each process being run has a unique process ID with which you would use to identify the kind of process being run

## Signal 
This is like an interrupt.When received it can have an impact on running your program or not.Some being automatic ,while some dependendent on user input..
