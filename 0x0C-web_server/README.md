A web server's main purpose is to accept requests from clients and provide them with the content they are asking for. To do this, web servers usually have both a parent process and child processes. The parent process listens for incoming requests while the child processes provide content for those requests. The main HTTP requests are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and HEAD. Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names into IP addresses. The different types of DNS records are A, CNAME, TXT, and MX. A record is an Address record that maps a domain name to an IP address. CNAME record is a Canonical Name record that creates an alias of one name to another. A TXT record is a Text record that stores text-based information while an MX record is a Mail Exchange record that specifies mail servers that accept email messages.
